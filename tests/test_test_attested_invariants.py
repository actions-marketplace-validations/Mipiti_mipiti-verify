"""Exhaustive check of what a test attestation is allowed to establish.

The acceptance decision is a predicate over a handful of independent
dimensions, so the whole space is small enough to enumerate rather than
sample. Every state is reached by breadth-first search from a valid
attestation, mutating one field per step, and each is judged twice: once by
the verifier and once by an oracle written directly from the invariants
below. A disagreement is a defect in whichever is wrong.

Sampled tests find the failures someone thought of. The defects this file
exists to catch were all of the other kind: a guard that silently did not
apply because two operands were both empty, and a claim satisfied by a test
that was collected but never ran.
