"""Formal verification of the sound-witness engine: the flagged set is a
superset of what is unsafe.

The engine behind ``sink_default_deny`` and ``typed_boundary`` reports one
thing: over a declared scope, every site where a value reaches a declared
sink takes a form the declaration admits. That claim is only worth
something in one direction -- the flagged set must CONTAIN every unsafe
site. A false alarm costs a reviewer an allowlist entry; a missed site
makes the witness a lie.

This checker states that direction over a grammar of small programs, one
per construct the engine must see through, in Python (its own parser), a
tree-sitter language and a hardware description language. The grammar is
fixed: every program runs on every invocation. A build that cannot read one
of the languages fails the checker rather than dropping its programs, so
the verdict always covers the whole claim and never a subset of it. Each program
declares its own ground truth -- the sites that are unsafe by
construction -- and the checker asserts:

  S1  every ground-truth site is flagged                      (soundness)
  S2  the verdict is PASS exactly on the programs whose ground truth is
      empty, whose scope the engine can read, and whose safety does not
      rest on a fact the engine does not read                  (usefulness)
  S3  a refusal says which of the fixed refusal reasons it is  (no silent
      pass through an unreadable scope, a vacuous sink list, or a stale
      allowlist entry)
  S4  a program that is safe only by a fact about the callee -- what it
      does with a value it accepts -- is refused, and the report says
      what to declare instead. These programs are named here so the
      conservatism is a stated property: a build that starts passing one
      of them has moved the decision from the value to the position, and
      this checker fails.

and then self-validates: each of the engine's four enumeration features
(alias tracking, wrapper discovery, escape hatches, stores to a named
target) is switched off in turn, and the harness FAILS unless the mutant
loses a site S1 requires. A property no mutant can break is a property
that was never being checked.
