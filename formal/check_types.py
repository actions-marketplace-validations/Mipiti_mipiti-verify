"""Formal verification of the assertion-type design.

An assertion type is one thing stated in four places: the platform's
catalogue (what a caller may submit), the structural verifier (what tier 1
decides), the tier-2 template (what the semantic tier is asked), and the
evidence class (what kind of thing the verdict rests on). A type that
exists in one place and not another is a claim nobody checks, or a check
nobody can invoke. These properties pin the four together:

  T1  every catalogue type has a registered structural verifier, or is in
      an explicit exemption list with a reason
  T2  the parameters a verifier READS (found by walking its source with
      ``ast``, through the helpers it hands ``params`` to) are the
      parameters the catalogue DECLARES: a key the verifier requires
      (``params["x"]`` with no ``.get`` guard) is catalogue-required; every catalogue-required key
      is read by the verifier or, for tier-2-only inputs, by the runner;
      an optional read (``params.get("x")``) is catalogue-declared or in an
      explicit allowance that is itself checked against the code
  T3  every registered type has a tier-2 template and every template names
      a registered type; every template uses only the variables the runner
      supplies (enumerated from the runner's render call, not assumed)
  T4  every template, rendered for every subject it can be rendered for,
      carries its family's fail-closed clause (an empty or irrelevant SOURCE_CODE is
      NO) and the injection-refusal clause
  T5  every registered type has exactly one evidence class, stated in the
      registry, and it is one of the declared vocabulary
  T7  the class the registry states for a type is the class the catalogue
      declares for it
  T8  the sink vocabulary is one vocabulary: the safe forms a value may
      take at a guarded position and the kinds of site a sink may be
      declared as are the same names in the catalogue and in the verifier,
      the params the catalogue publishes offer exactly those names, and the
      verifier's own reader accepts each of them and refuses a name outside

T1, T2, T6, T7 and T8 need the catalogue (``mipiti_mcp.assertion_types``);
when it is not installed, or predates a vocabulary, those are reported as
not established and the exit status still reflects only what was checked.
T3-T5 need nothing beyond this package.
