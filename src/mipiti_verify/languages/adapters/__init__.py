"""Runner adapters: one per test runner, each able to select one test, run
it, run it under coverage, and disable a mechanism for the run.

``attest-dependence`` and ``attest-reach`` are runner-agnostic; every
runner-specific fact lives behind ``RunnerAdapter``. The registry picks an
adapter from the project's files (``detect_adapter``), and ``--runner``
overrides it. The invariants every adapter keeps:

* ``run`` maps the runner's exit status to ``passed`` / ``failed`` /
  ``error``; a run that selected no test, could not start, timed out, or
  failed to build is ``error``, never ``failed``.
* ``disable`` either disables the mechanism for the whole run or raises
  ``DisableError`` with the reason; a source mutation is compile-checked
  first and restored byte-for-byte afterwards.
* ``run_with_coverage`` returns a report the coverage readers accept or
  raises ``AdapterError`` with the reason.
