"""Dependence attestation: does a test fail once its mechanism is disabled?

This is one of the two commands in the package that run tests, and it runs
them in the customer's own test job, never during verification. Each
``(test, mechanism)`` pair is run once with the mechanism disabled through
the project's runner adapter (``languages.adapters``): an import-time stub
for Python, a mocking setup file for jest / vitest / mocha, and a
compile-checked source mutation, restored byte-for-byte afterwards, for
every other language. The outcome is recorded as a fact. A test that fails
without the mechanism depends on it. A test that still passes proves
nothing about the mechanism, and the record says so. A pair whose
mechanism could not be disabled, or whose mutated tree did not compile,
is recorded as ``error`` with the reason, which the verifier reads as
unknown, never as either outcome.
