"""Sound witnesses: ``sink_default_deny`` and ``typed_boundary``.

Both types state something about EVERY site in a declared scope, which is
what separates them from a scan (which finds a form) and from a test
(which drives one path). The statement is decided by one engine,
parameterised entirely by the assertion's params: which callees are
sinks, which positions of a sink are guarded, which static forms of a
value are safe, which sites a reviewer has excepted and why. Nothing is
inferred from a name, a path or a description.

``sink_default_deny``
    Over every source file in ``scope``, every site of a declared sink
    receives, at each guarded position, only a form the safe-form
    vocabulary accepts -- decided from the value written there, and for a
    data structure from every element it was written with -- or is an
    allowlisted site with a reviewed reason.
    Every site the engine could not classify counts as a violation. A
    scope that matches nothing, a file it cannot read, parse or name a
    language for, and a declared sink that never occurs are refusals: the
    witness is sound modulo the declared sink list and never vacuous.

``typed_boundary``
    Every guarded sink position in ``scope`` receives a value whose static
    form is a construction of ``boundary_type`` through one of the
    declared ``constructors``, and every construction site of that type
    in scope receives only literal or named-constant arguments or is
    allowlisted. Construction tracking is by name; a signed construction
    statement from a compile-checked probe upgrades it.

Sound in one direction only: the engine over-approximates. A callee is
matched by its leaf name on any receiver; an alias, a partial application
and a wrapper that forwards a parameter into a guarded position are sinks
too; a value escaping into reflection, dynamic evaluation, a macro body or
a function pointer is a violation.

A pass is returned only when every file the scope names was read and every
site in it was classified, so anything that leaves part of the scope
unexamined is a refusal and never a caveat on a pass: a file with no
parser for its language, a link in the region a scope entry searches, a
scope larger than the run can hold, and a forwarding chain that had not
closed when the discovery budget ran out. An allowlist excepts a site the
run flagged; it never excuses a part of the scope the run did not read,
it is bounded by the sites the run examined, and a run whose every
flagged site is an exception -- with no value anywhere in the scope
admitted by form -- has decided nothing mechanically and is a refusal
too.

Each language is read through ``languages.calls``: Python by its own
``ast``, every other tabled grammar (Verilog, SystemVerilog and VHDL
included) by tree-sitter. There is no third strategy. The parser used is
recorded per file.
